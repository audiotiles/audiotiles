VERSION=2.0
<b><size=18>AudioTiles 2.0 is officially here!</size></b>
<size=9>
I'ts been a long time coming, but we're dropping a bunch of new features and fixes we felt deserved a major version upgrade.

What's new:
* <b>No More Ads!!</b>
    After much deliberation, we decided to remove ads from the app entirely. No more LITE vs paid ad-free version. No more pesky ad bar. Enjoy!
* <b>More Tiles in More Places</b>
    You may notice a change in the scale of the UI. We now attempt to adjust the UI scaling to match your physical screen size (so larger screens will have room for more tiles). If the detected scale is not to your liking (can happen if the device reports an incorrect DPI), you can set a custom scaling by going to Menu > About AudioTiles and adjusting the slider at the bottom of the screen.
* <b>Sound Types</b>
    To better optimize performance (and allow more tiles), you can specify your sounds as 'Ambience' and 'Effect' in the Tile Settings.
    Use 'Ambience' for background / longer sound files, and 'Effect' for short sound bytes.
* <b>Fading</b>
    In response to some real user feedback (thanks users!) we have tweaked how fading works:
    Now when you pause or resume (instead of just at the beginning or end), 'Ambience' sounds will fade according to the settings.
* <b>Downloadable Sound Packs</b>
    Instead of taking up space in the app, sound packs are now hosted & downloaded separately. Don't worry, any sound packs you had already unpacked should still be there.
