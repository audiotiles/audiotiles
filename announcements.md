VERSION=2.0
<b><size=18>AudioTiles 2.0 is officially here!</size></b>
<size=9>
I'ts been a long time coming, but we're dropping a bunch of new features and fixes we felt deserved a major version upgrade.

What's new:
* <b>No More Ads!</b>
    After much deliberation, we decided to remove ads from the app entirely. No more LITE vs paid ad-free version.
* <b>Sound Types</b>
    To better optimize performance (and allow more tiles), you can specify your sounds as 'Ambience' and 'Effect' in the Tile Settings.
    Use 'Ambience' for background / longer sound files, and 'Effect' for short sound bytes.
* <b>Fading</b>
    In response to some real user feedback (thanks users!) we have tweaked how fading works:
    Now when you pause or resume (instead of just at the beginning or end), 'Ambience' sounds will fade according to the settings.
* <b>Downloadable Sound Packs</b>
    Instead of taking up space in the app, sound packs are now hosted & downloaded separately.
